                    Makayla is a natural helper and has spent her working life in various public service positions. Much
                    of her expertise
                    has been developed while working with individuals with disabilities through teaching an adaptive
                    gymnastics class, being
                    a 1-on-1 support staff at a day camp, a teaching assistant in several programs, and a direct support
                    professional in the
                    community. Makayla also started and owns her own photo booth rental company. Being a quick learner
                    eager to help people,
                    Makayla developed a considerable interest in the insurance industry the moment she learned about the
                    values of M-Power.
                    She is excited to begin her Medicare journey with M-Power and help more people. Makayla was born and
                    raised in Cicero,
                    NY but recently moved to Shortsville, NY with her boyfriend. They like to spend their free time
                    playing cards, board,
                    and video games, kayaking, biking, whitewater rafting, and most importantly, cuddling their cat,
                    Lulu. Makayla also has
                    a huge family and family time is very important to her. Additionally, Makayla finds several
                    non-profit organizations
                    close to her heart and tries to volunteer as much as possible. Examples of these organizations
                    include the American
                    Warrior Festival, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, Our Coffee Connection, and Before the
                    Last Call.
