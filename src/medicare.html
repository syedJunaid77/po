                        30th,
                        1965.
                        Former President Harry Truman and his wife were
                        the very first beneficiaries. Today over 56 million Americans are enrolled in the Medicare
                        program.
                        That’s most
                        Americans ages 65 and older, regardless of their income or health status.</p>

                    <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-lg">Original Medicare has only two parts: A and B. Part A
                        is for hospital insurance and Part B is for medical insurance. You
                        can use any doctor or hospital that takes Medicare, anywhere in the U.S. If you want drug
                        coverage,
                        you can join a
                        separate Part D plan.</p>

                                Medicare Part A is for hospital care. It covers things like your hospital room, meals,
                                general nursing and hospital
                                services and supplies. It does not cover private duty nursing, comfort or convenience
                                items.
                                Coverage is for up to
                                90 days per Benefit Period and the first 60 days are covered at 100% after the Medicare
                                Part
                                A Deductible is met.
                                You pay an out of pocket cost for any days after 60. There is an additional 60 days of
                                coverage called lifetime
                                reserve days, but it can only be used once. It’s important to note that the deductible
                                is
                                $1,632 for 2024 and
                                applies to any new Benefit Period. So, if you go into the hospital for a couple of days,
                                get
                                discharged and then
                                return a week later – you are still in the same Benefit Period and will not be charged
                                again
                                for the $1,632 Part A
                                Deductible that you incurred on the first confinement. If you are out of the hospital
                                and/or
                                Skilled Nursing
                                Facility for at least 60 days in a row, a return to the hospital would begin a new
                                Benefit
                                Period and you would owe
                                the Part A Deductible. There are usually no premiums for Part A if you or your spouse
                                paid
                                Medicare taxes while
                                working (a.k.a. ‘Premium-free Part A’).

                       Medicare Part A is for hospital care. It covers things like your hospital room, meals, general nursing and hospital services and supplies. It does not cover private duty nursing, comfort or convenience items. Coverage is for up to 90 days per Benefit Period and the first 60 days are covered at 100% after the Medicare Part A Deductible is met. You pay an out of pocket cost for any days after 60. There is an additional 60 days of coverage called lifetime reserve days, but it can only be used once. It’s important to note that the deductible is $1,632 for 2024 and applies to any new Benefit Period. So, if you go into the hospital for a couple of days, get discharged and then return a week later – you are still in the same Benefit Period and will not be charged again for the $1,632 Part A Deductible that you incurred on the first confinement. If you are out of the hospital and/or Skilled Nursing Facility for at least 60 days in a row, a return to the hospital would begin a new Benefit Period and you would owe the Part A Deductible. There are usually no premiums for Part A if you or your spouse paid Medicare taxes while working (a.k.a. ‘Premium-free Part A’).

                  Medicare Part B is optional. It covers things like doctors’ visits, lab work and x-rays outside a hospital stay. It is an 80 – 20 plan meaning Medicare pays 80% of the approved expenses and you are responsible for the remaining 20%. For 2024, the premium for Part B starts at $174.70 per month (or higher depending on your income). There is a $240.00 deductible, but the deductible is for the whole calendar year, not per occurrence. If you collect a Social Security check, your premium will most likely be deducted.

Medicare pays a fixed amount for your care each month to the companies offering Medicare Advantage Plans. Companies providing Medicare Advantage Plans must follow rules set by Medicare.

                      Medicare prescription drug coverage is an optional benefit offered to everyone who has Medicare. There are two ways to get prescription drug coverage.
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-2 m-4 text-lg">
  1. Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (Part D) - These plans (sometimes called "PDPs") add drug coverage to Original Medicare, some Medicare   Cost Plans, some Medicare Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS) Plans, and Medicare Medical Savings Account (MSA) Plans.
  <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-2 m-4 text-lg">
  2. Medicare Advantage Plan (Part C) (like an HMO or PPO) or other Medicare health plan that offer Medicare prescription drug coverage.   You get all of your Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) coverage, and prescription drug coverage   (Part D), through these plans. Medicare Advantage Plans with prescription drug coverage are sometimes called “MA-PDs.” You must have Part   A and Part B to join a Medicare Advantage Plan.
  <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-2 m-4">
  Important Note: Each plan that offers prescription drug coverage through Medicare Part D must give at least a standard level of coverage   set by Medicare. Plans can vary the list of prescription drugs they cover (called a formulary) and how they place drugs into different   "tiers" on their formularies
